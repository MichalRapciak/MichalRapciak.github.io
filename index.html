    <p class="paragraph">

        He is best known for his many best-selling albums such as 'Take Care', 'Views', 'Scorpion' and 'Certified Lover Boy'. <br />
        In his long-running music career he reached the 'Billboard 200' Number 1 spot a total of 10 times so far, and has collected 9 hits on the 'Billboard 100'. <br />

    <h2 class="headings" id="ranking">Top 10 Album Ranking</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Drake had many great albums that topped the worldwide charts, so it is difficult to rank them without disrespecting some of them.<br />
        But as a fan page this is a necessary part of the process, so unfortunately some sacrifices will have to be made as an album will have to be bottom :(.<br />
        This is my ranking of the Top 10 Drake albums as of 2022.<br />
    </p>

    <ul class="paragraph">
        <li>1. Certified Lover Boy</li>
        <li>2. Scorpion</li>
        <li>3. So Far Gone</li>
        <li>4. More Life</li>
        <li>5. Take Care</li>
        <li>6. Thank Me Later</li>
        <li>7. Nothing Was The Same</li>
        <li>8. Views</li>
        <li>9. Scary Hours 2</li>
        <li>10. If You're Reading This It's Too Late</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Certified Lover Boy just has to take the top spot for me. It is the best project Drake has released, simply said. It's Drake at his best.<br />
        Songs like 'Way Too Sexy' and 'No Friends In The Industry' are some of the best radio singles Drake has released, and the entire album is very innovative.<br />
        Scorpion is a close second as it is filled to the brim with great songs from Drake, including 'God's Plan', 'Nice For What' and 'Nonstop'. <br />
        So Far Gone is an earlier, much more raw and hungry Drake as he tried to break out onto the scene, successfully so.<br />
        More Life and Take Care are both great albums, filled with slower and sadder songs.<br />
        Thank Me Later and Nothing Was The Same are both good projects, although the low points can drag on for too long.<br />
        While Views and Scary Hours are 2, they are mostly forgettable outside of a few amazing tracks.<br />
        While at Number 10, IYRTITL is still a good piece of music and should be treated with respect, as it was Drake leaving his comfort zone for something new.<br />
        <br />
        Overall, while CLB and Scorpion are at the top, all 10 albums are great and worth a listen to.<br />
