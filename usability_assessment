    <h2 class="headings" id="about">1 - Visibility Of System Status</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        In order to get somewhere or do something, you must understand what is going on now. </br>
        This is especially important for maps, as you need to know where you need to go next from your current location. </br>
        This is where visibility of system status comes in - you need to actively tell the user where they are. </br>
        Google maps does this well by showing where the user is currently, the direction they are facing, and how they have to keep going. </br>
        This can be improved on though, as google often has information of streets being full of traffic or services being down. </br>
        Google Maps could use this and warn the user in advance if the place they want to go to is closed, </br>
        or if the road they will be driving on has lots of traffic. </br>
