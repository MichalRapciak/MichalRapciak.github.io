    <h2 class="headings">NUMBER 1 - HOT SAUCE INCIDENT</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        One of the first things to come to mind is the recent 'Hot Sauce' incident that Drake was under fire for. </br>
        It was revealed by tabloid media that Drake allegedly filled a condom with hot sauce. </br>
        This was meant to be an ingenious way of getting rid of the sperm in the condom, </br>
        making sure that the model he was having intercourse with could not impregnate herself without his consent. </br>
