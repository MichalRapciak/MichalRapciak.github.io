    <h2 class="headings" id="about">INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Google Maps is one of the most used websites by many. </br>
      Everyone knows it, everyone holds it up as the benchmark for navigation apps. </br>
      But why is that so? What makes Google Maps so good? </br>
      Is there anything that can be improved in it? That is what this report will be about. </br>

      I will be studying Google Maps - it's usability and accessibility, it's upsides and downsides, and why it is as popular as it is. </br>
      It's not very often we have a website that becomes such a standout benchmark for such a long time. </br>
      I want to find out what makes users return to Google Maps - what does it have that other map websites do not? </br>
      How accessible is it to users? There is many different uses for maps, so how does Google Maps live up to that? </br>
      That is what I will be exploring in this report. </br>
